        Hi, I'm <span class="title-gradient">Artie</span>
      </h1>
      <p class="max-w-6xl text-base">
        Howdy! My name’s Artie, though many call me other names such as Artsy.
        I’m from Australia and I have a passion for programming, networking, and
        anything else relating to computers / technology. I love spending my
        time with friends, listening to music, reading documentation, and of
        course programming!

        <br />
        <br />

        I currently work at my friend’s company XtremeFX as the Full-stack
        Developer / Engineer, there’s been slow progress within the company,
        though all is well.

        <br />
        <br />

        If you wish to talk with me, please be nice! I’m shy around new people
        I’m not familiar with.
